# Tests plan


## ADVERTISMENTS
**Do not power up the sonar outside water**. Water is necessary to cold the sonar, it can heat up if it is pinging in the air. Even in standby mode ou can't be sur that the sonar will not heat up.

## Before starting
Flolow the [`README`](../../README.md) to install and build the package. Put the soanr under water before powwer it. Run `ros2 launch oculus_ros2 default.launch.py` to make the tests.
If you are using RQT, make sure to have sourced your workspace (in order to read oculus_interfaces massages).
## Integration Tests
### Without Soanar Test
1. Check that the driver ask to if the soanr is properly connected.
1. Wait 2 minutes. 
1. Check you don't have any warning or error in addition of non sonar reached.

#### Colcon Tests
### Underwater Tests

#### Standby Mode
The sonar must go to stanby mode when the the is not any subscrber to `/oculus_sonar/ping` topic. In order to test this fonctionnality you must not run `default.launch.py` launch file but you must start on the node on alown with `ros2 launch oculus_ros2 pings_only.launch.py`.
1. Launch the oculus_sonar_node with `ros2 launch oculus_ros2 pings_only.launch.py`.
1. Make sur there is no subscriber on `/oculus_sonar/ping` by running `ros2 topic info /oculus_sonar/ping`.
1. Set the frenquency to 750 kHZ (`ros2 param set /oculus_sonar frequency_mode 1` in ROS CLI). 
1. Set the ping rate to 50 HZ (mode 2) (`ros2 param set /oculus_sonar ping_rate 2` in ROS CLI). 
1. Check you get a warning telling you are in standby mode.
1. Check that there is not any status message send by the sonar on `/oculus_sonar/status` by echoing the topic (`ros2 topic echo /oculus_sonar/status`).
1. If you are in a quiet environement you can take the sonar out of the water **WARNING DO NOT KEEP THE SONAR OUT OF WATER. IF THE SONAR START TO HEAT UP PUT IT BACK ON WATER** and chek that can not hear any ping sound. Put back the sonar under water.
1. Run a subscriber of the topic `/oculus_sonar/ping` (`ros2 topic echo /oculus_sonar/ping` in ROS CLI).
1. Check you don't get the warning telling you are in standby mode any more.
1. Check that there is ping and status messages send by the sonar on `/oculus_sonar/ping` and `/oculus_sonar/status` with a 50 Hz fr√©quency (you may use RQT).
1. If you are in a quiet environement you can take the sonar out of the water **WARNING DO NOT KEEP THE SONAR OUT OF WATER. IF THE SONAR START TO HEAT UP PUT IT BACK ON WATER** and chek that hear the pings sound. Put back the sonar under water.
1. Stopt to subscriber the topic `/oculus_sonar/ping`.
1. Make sur there is no subscriber on `/oculus_sonar/ping` by running `ros2 topic info /oculus_sonar/ping`.
1. Check you get a warning telling you are in standby mode.
1. Check that there is not any status message send by the sonar on `/oculus_sonar/status` by echoing the topic (`ros2 topic echo /oculus_sonar/status`).
1. If you are in a quiet environement you can take the sonar out of the water **WARNING DO NOT KEEP THE SONAR OUT OF WATER. IF THE SONAR START TO HEAT UP PUT IT BACK ON WATER** and chek that can not hear any ping sound. Put back the sonar under water.

*Do not forget to launch with `ros2 launch oculus_ros2 default.launch.py` again for the next tests.*

*What are range gain and witch artefacts they cause*
TODO @hugoyvrn
1. Set the parameter `send_gain` is set to **false**.
1. Make a pole move in front of the sonar.
1. Check there are artefacts visible on the image on the topic `/oculus_sonar/image`. If there not any aterfact, change the sonar and pole configuration in order to see some. Once you can see some artefacts continue the test.
1. Set the parameter `send_gain` is set to **true**.
1. Put the sonar horizontaly.
1. Make a pole move in front of the sonar.
1. Check they are not any artefacts visible on the image on the topic `/oculus_sonar/image`.

*Make sur the parameter `send_gain` is set to true before doing other tests.*
