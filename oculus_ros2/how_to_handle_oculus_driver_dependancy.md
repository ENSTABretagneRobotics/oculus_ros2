# Question to chatGPT on https://chat.openai.com/chat

I have 
```cmake
install(PROGRAMS
    src/my_python_script.py
    DESTINATION bin)
```
in my `CMakeListe.txt` but I want to install `my_python_script.py` under a different name : `new_name.py` how can I modify my `CMakeListe.txt` to do so ?

To change the name of a file during installation with CMake, you can use the RENAME option. This option allows you to specify a different name for the file when it is installed. Here is how you can use the RENAME option to change the name of my_python_script.py to new_name.py:

install(PROGRAMS
    src/my_python_script.py
    RENAME new_name.py
    DESTINATION bin)

This will cause CMake to install the my_python_script.py script as new_name.py in the bin directory.

If I have sevral scripts in my install, and I just want to rename one of them, how I do s ?

If you have multiple scripts in your install() command and you only want to rename one of them, you can specify the RENAME option for that specific script. For example, if you have two scripts in your install() command, script1.py and script2.py, and you want to rename script1.py to new_script1.py, you can use the following install() command:

install(PROGRAMS
    src/script1.py
    RENAME new_script1.py
    src/script2.py
    DESTINATION bin)

This will cause CMake to install script1.py as new_script1.py and script2.py with its original name in the bin directory. Note that the RENAME option only applies to the file immediately preceding it, so you should specify the RENAME option immediately after the file you want to rename.

Can I do  
```cmake
install(PROGRAMS
    src/script2.py
    src/script1.py
    RENAME new_script1.py
    DESTINATION bin)
```

Yes, you can specify the RENAME option after the file you want to rename, even if that file appears after other files in the install() command. However, as mentioned earlier, the RENAME option only applies to the file immediately preceding it, so in your example, script1.py would still be installed with its original name.

If you want to rename script1.py to new_script1.py, you would need to specify the RENAME option immediately after script1.py, like this:

install(PROGRAMS
    src/script2.py
    src/script1.py
    RENAME new_script1.py
    DESTINATION bin)

This will cause CMake to install script2.py with its original name and script1.py as new_script1.py in the bin directory.

Can I do
```cmake
install(PROGRAMS
    src/script2.py
    src/script1.py RENAME new_script1.py
    DESTINATION bin)

```

No, you cannot specify the RENAME option directly after the file you want to rename without separating the two with a newline or a semicolon. The RENAME option must be on a separate line or separated by a semicolon from the file you want to rename, like this:

```cmake
install(PROGRAMS
    src/script2.py
    src/script1.py
    RENAME new_script1.py
    DESTINATION bin)

Or:

install(PROGRAMS
    src/script2.py
    src/script1.py; RENAME new_script1.py
    DESTINATION bin)
```

If you specify the RENAME option directly after the file without separating them with a newline or semicolon, CMake will interpret it as part of the file name, which will result in an error.

To run my script I have to get those dependecy : 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/oculus_driver.git
```
In /oculus_driver/python
```bash
cd oculus_driver/python
pip3 install --user -e .
```
How can I automatise thi in a `CMakeList.txt` in order to not have to clone my self the git repo

To automate the process of installing dependencies for your script, you can use the FetchContent module in CMake. The FetchContent module allows you to download and install external dependencies as part of your CMake build process.

To use the FetchContent module, you first need to include it in your CMakeList.txt file by adding the following line at the top of the file:

include(FetchContent)

Next, you can use the FetchContent_Declare and FetchContent_MakeAvailable commands to download and install the oculus_driver repository as a dependency for your script. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```cmake
# Include the FetchContent module
include(FetchContent)

# Declare the oculus_driver repository as a dependency
FetchContent_Declare(
    oculus_driver
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/oculus_driver.git
)

# Make the oculus_driver repository available for use in your project
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(oculus_driver)

# Install your script and its dependencies
install(PROGRAMS
    src/my_python_script.py
    DESTINATION bin
    DEPENDS oculus_driver)
```

In this example, the FetchContent_Declare command declares the oculus_driver repository as a dependency for your project, and the FetchContent_MakeAvailable command makes the contents of the repository available for use in your project. Finally, the install() command installs your script and specifies that it depends on the oculus_driver repository.

When you build your project, CMake will automatically download and install the oculus_driver repository as a dependency for your script, so you don't have to clone it manually.

But where you are doing the 
```bash
pip3 install --user -e .
```
command ?

In the example I provided, the pip3 install --user -e . command is not being executed by CMake. This is because CMake only handles the process of downloading and installing the oculus_driver repository, but it does not automatically install the Python packages contained in the repository.

To install the Python packages in the oculus_driver repository, you would need to use a separate tool, such as pip, to install the packages. You can either run the pip3 install --user -e . command manually after the oculus_driver repository has been downloaded and installed by CMake, or you can add a custom build step to your CMake build process to execute this command automatically.

Here is an example of how you can add a custom build step to your CMakeList.txt file to execute the pip3 install --user -e . command automatically after the oculus_driver repository has been downloaded and installed:

```cmake
# Include the FetchContent module
include(FetchContent)

# Declare the oculus_driver repository as a dependency
FetchContent_Declare(
    oculus_driver
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/oculus_driver.git
)

# Make the oculus_driver repository available for use in your project
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(oculus_driver)

# Install your script and its dependencies
install(PROGRAMS
    src/my_python_script.py
    DESTINATION bin
    DEPENDS oculus_driver)

# Add a custom build step to install the Python packages in the oculus_driver repository
add_custom_command(
    TARGET oculus_driver
    POST_BUILD
    COMMAND pip3 install --user -e .
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${oculus_driver_SOURCE_DIR}/python
)
```

In this example, the add_custom_command command adds a custom build step to the oculus_driver target, which will execute the pip3 install --user -e . command after the oculus_driver repository has been downloaded and installed by CMake. The WORKING_DIRECTORY argument specifies the directory where the command should be executed, which in this case is the python directory in the oculus_driver repository.

When you build your project, CMake will first download and install the oculus_driver repository as a dependency for your script, and then it will automatically execute the pip3 install --user -e . command to install the Python packages in the repository. This will ensure that your script has all of the necessary dependencies installed when it is run.

It i clean to modify pip user in a `CMakeList.txt` ? It may be nicer to warn the user at least

It is generally not considered good practice to modify a user's pip installation without their explicit consent, as this can potentially cause conflicts with the user's existing packages or cause other unexpected issues.

Instead of modifying a user's pip installation, it is typically better to provide instructions for the user to install the required dependencies themselves, either using pip or another package manager. This allows the user to have more control over their own environment and avoid any potential conflicts with their existing packages.

If you want to provide instructions for the user to install the necessary dependencies for your script, you can do so in the documentation for your project or in a separate installation guide. You can also include a check in your script to verify that the necessary dependencies are installed and provide an error message if they are not, so that the user is aware of any missing dependencies when they try to run your script.

Here is an example of how you could add a check for the oculus_driver dependencies in your Python script:

```pyhton
try:
    import oculus_driver
except ImportError:
    print("Error: The oculus_driver package is not installed. Please install it using pip or another package manager.")
    sys.exit(1)
```

This code will try to import the oculus_driver package, and if it is not installed, it will print an error message and exit the script with a non-zero exit code. This will inform the user that they need to install the oculus_driver package in order to run your script. You can also provide instructions for how to install the package in the error message, so that the user knows how to fix the issue.

Can't I warn the user when he build the CMakelist.txt ? And let him decide during the compilation if he want to modify his pip ?

Yes, you can warn the user and ask for their consent to modify their pip installation during the CMake build process. To do this, you can use the message() command in CMake to display a message to the user, and the option() command to define a user-configurable option that the user can use to control whether their pip installation is modified.

Here is an example of how you can use the message() and option() commands to ask the user for permission to modify their pip installation during the CMake build process:

# Include the FetchContent module
include(FetchContent)

# Ask the user if they want to allow CMake to modify their pip installation
option(MODIFY_PIP "Allow CMake to modify your pip installation to install the oculus_driver dependencies" OFF)

```cmake
if(MODIFY_PIP)
    # Declare the oculus_driver repository as a dependency
    FetchContent_Declare(
        oculus_driver
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/oculus_driver.git
    )

    # Make the oculus_driver repository available for use in your project
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(oculus_driver)

    # Add a custom build step to install the Python packages in the oculus_driver repository
    add_custom_command(
        TARGET oculus_driver
        POST_BUILD
        COMMAND pip3 install --user -e .
        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${oculus_driver_SOURCE_DIR}/python
    )

    # Install your script and its dependencies
    install(PROGRAMS
        src/my_python_script.py
        DESTINATION bin
        DEPENDS oculus_driver)
else()
    # Display a warning message if the user does not allow CMake to modify their pip installation
    message(WARNING "CMake will not modify your pip installation to install the oculus_driver dependencies. Please install the dependencies manually to use this script.")
endif()
```

In this example, the option() command defines a user-configurable option called MODIFY_PIP that allows the user to control whether CMake is allowed to modify their pip installation. If the user sets this option to ON, CMake will download and install the oculus_driver repository and use pip to install the Python packages in the repository. If the user sets this option to OFF, CMake will not modify the user's pip installation, but will display a warning message to the user informing them that they need to install the dependencies manually in order to use the script.

When the user builds your project, they can use the -DMODIFY_PIP=ON or -DMODIFY_PIP=OFF option to control whether their pip installation is modified. For example, they could use the following command to build your project and allow CMake to modify their pip installation:

```cmake
cmake -DMODIFY_PIP=ON ..
```

Alternatively, they could use the following command to build your project without modifying their pip installation:

```cmake
cmake -DMODIFY_PIP=OFF ..
```

I don't want to ask any thing to the user if the `pip3 install --user -e .` command is already done, can I verify it before asking ? 

Yes, you can verify if the pip3 install --user -e . command has already been executed before asking the user for permission to modify their pip installation. To do this, you can use the find_package() command in CMake to check if the oculus_driver package is already installed, and only ask the user for permission to modify their pip installation if the package is not found.

Here is an example of how you can use the find_package() command to check if the oculus_driver package is already installed before asking the user for permission to modify their pip installation:

```cmake
# Include the FetchContent module
include(FetchContent)

# Check if the oculus_driver package is already installed
find_package(oculus_driver)

if(NOT oculus_driver_FOUND)
    # Ask the user if they want to allow CMake to modify their pip installation
    option(MODIFY_PIP "Allow CMake to modify your pip installation to install the oculus_driver dependencies" OFF)

    if(MODIFY_PIP)
        # Declare the oculus_driver repository as a dependency
        FetchContent_Declare(
            oculus_driver
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/oculus_driver.git
        )

        # Make the oculus_driver repository available for use in your project
        FetchContent_MakeAvailable(oculus_driver)

        # Add a custom build step to install the Python packages in the oculus_driver repository
        add_custom_command(
            TARGET oculus_driver
            POST_BUILD
            COMMAND pip3 install --user -e .
            WORKING_DIRECTORY ${oculus_driver_SOURCE_DIR}/python
        )

        # Install your script and its dependencies
        install(PROGRAMS
            src/my_python_script.py
            DESTINATION bin
            DEPENDS oculus_driver)
    else()
        # Display a warning message if the user does not allow CMake to modify their pip installation
